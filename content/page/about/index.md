I enjoy learning and creative projects.

I appreciate monsters, creatures, dragons, horror, dark colors, and dark days.

----

I wanted somewhere to log my "process" when I create things 
(process in quotes because lmao): 
- organized, for future reference
- digital format for shareability and easy referencing
- Markdown-first because I abhor making html-first content, making doc/pdfs, and especially -- Microsoft Word

And to: 
- log and learn from my mistakes. 
- note any useful strategies or techniques. 
- collect any helpful resources in one place. 
- maybe learn some Golang while I'm at it?
  - IDK. 
  - Some people made it sound like you had to learn Golang to launch on Hugo and I'm finding that's really not the case.
    - Seriously the amount of Golang I know at this point is still 0 haha

And so, here I am.
