# Hello World
## Hugo is a markdown-first static site generator.
I guess the TOC doesn't detect top level headers
### but what happens when there are more headers?
that's my question
#### and there's one way to find out
by making a ton of them.
I want to see what the line settings loook like
it doesn't look like partials is doing anything so idk.

## Syntax
I'm just trying to see how the TOC works now

## Header 3
because I've seen some varieties have numbers on them instead of bullet points
