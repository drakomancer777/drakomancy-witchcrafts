# Hello World
## Hugo is a markdown-first static site generator.
I guess the TOC doesn't detect top level headers
### but what happens when there are more headers?
that's my question
#### and there's one way to find out
by making a ton of them.
I want to see what the line settings loook like
it doesn't look like partials is doing anything so idk.

## Syntax
I'm just trying to see how the TOC works now

## Header 3
because I've seen some varieties have numbers on them instead of bullet points

## Definition list
 Supposedly, this is an extension enabled by default.
Lets give it a try

**Apple**
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus malus in the family Rosaceae
:   An American computer company

**Orange**
:    The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.

Definitions can span multiple lines.

**Multiple-line-definitions**
:   if the definition spans more than one line, you should indent the 
    on each line. However, it is also not required to indent on each
    line


**Multi-paragraph-definitions**
:   definitions can contain multiple paragraphs. But I think you have to 
    remember to put a space between the term and the definition so that 
    the renderer wraps the definition paragraph in p tags.

    1. lists
    2. are supposed to work

    >blockquotes
    > too
